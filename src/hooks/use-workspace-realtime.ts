/**
 * Live Workspace updates via Supabase Realtime on `flow_runs`.
 *
 * The core logic lives in the pure `createWorkspaceRealtimeSubscription`
 * so it can be unit-tested without React rendering or a real Supabase
 * connection; `useWorkspaceRealtime` is a thin hook wrapper over it that
 * reuses the application's existing browser client (`createClient` from
 * `@/lib/supabase/client` — never a second client).
 *
 * Behavior contract (see the task spec):
 * - One channel per account+flow: `workspace-${accountId}-${flowId}`.
 * - Subscribes to `postgres_changes` on `flow_runs`, event `*`,
 *   filter `flow_id=eq.<flowId>`.
 * - Any INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE schedules the existing table reload,
 *   debounced (~1.2s) so a flow advancing through nodes produces ONE
 *   refetch, not many.
 * - The reload goes through the existing `reloadTable()` /
 *   `setRefreshSeq` path — the server RPC stays the single source of
 *   truth. No client-side row insertion, no payload filtering here.
 * - A reconnect back to `SUBSCRIBED` schedules one recovery reload so
 *   events missed while the socket was down are picked up.
 * - Cleanup removes the channel and cancels any pending debounce.
 *
 * Account isolation is guaranteed by the existing `flow_runs` RLS
 * (`flow_runs_select ... USING (is_account_member(account_id))`) — the
 * Realtime subscription can never receive another account's rows, and
 * the `/api/flows/[id]/table` refetch re-applies authorization and all
 * filters.
