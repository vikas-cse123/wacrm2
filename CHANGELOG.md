# Changelog

User-visible changes in `wacrm`. Self-hosters: when pulling an update,
check this file for any **migration required** notes and apply the
matching SQL files from `supabase/migrations/` against your Supabase
project before restarting the app.

Versions follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Pre-1.0, `MINOR` bumps cover new modules; `PATCH` bumps cover bug fixes
and polish.

## [Unreleased]

Foundation for multi-user accounts. Every wacrm install becomes
multi-tenant on the database side: a single user's signup creates a
fresh "account", and every row is scoped to that account rather than
to the user directly. The user-visible invite / members surface lands
in follow-up PRs gated by the `'account_sharing'` beta feature flag —
this release is wiring with no behaviour change on its own. Existing
self-hosted instances keep working: every existing user is backfilled
as the sole owner of their own account and sees identical data.

### Changed

- **Tenancy moves from per-user to per-account.** RLS on every
  domain table (contacts, conversations, messages, broadcasts,
  automations, flows, pipelines, templates, tags, …) now checks
  account membership via a new SECURITY DEFINER helper
  `is_account_member(account_id, min_role)` instead of
  `auth.uid() = user_id`. The `user_id` columns stay on every row
  for assignment / audit but no longer enforce isolation.
- **WhatsApp config is one-per-account, not one-per-user.** The
  `whatsapp_config.UNIQUE(user_id)` constraint is replaced by
  `UNIQUE(account_id)`.
- **`flow_runs` idempotency key swaps to `(account_id, contact_id)`**
  so two accounts sharing a contact phone number can each run their
  own flows independently.
- **The signup trigger (`handle_new_user`) now also creates a
  personal account** and links the new profile to it as `owner`.

### Fixed

- **Inbound WhatsApp messages now land in the shared inbox.** The
  webhook + automations + flows engines used to route inbound
  events by `user_id`, which after the 017 migration only matched
  the WhatsApp config owner's automations / flows — teammates'
  rules never fired. PR 8 of the multi-user series flips every
  lookup to `account_id` so any member of the account sees the
  inbound message and any teammate's automation or flow can react
  to it. Also fixes incipient NOT NULL violations on
  `automation_logs`, `automation_pending_executions`, `flow_runs`,
  and `deals` — those tables gained `account_id NOT NULL` in 017
  but the engines hadn't yet been updated to populate it.

### Added

- **Account & member management API** — server-side endpoints
  for the upcoming Members tab UI. All routes are role-gated and
  return Supabase-RLS-scoped data.
  - `GET /api/account` — caller's account + role. Any member.
  - `PATCH /api/account` — rename the account. Admin+.
  - `GET /api/account/members` — list members. Email visible to
    admin+ only; agents/viewers see name + avatar + role +
    joined date.
  - `PATCH /api/account/members/[userId]` — change a member's
    role. Admin+. Owner promotion/demotion goes through the
    transfer endpoint instead.
  - `DELETE /api/account/members/[userId]` — remove a member.
    Admin+. The removed user keeps their login and is moved to a
    freshly-created personal account (mirror of the signup flow).
  - `POST /api/account/transfer-ownership` — owner only. Atomic
    swap with the named member.
- **Invitation API + redeem flow** — the no-email, link-only
  invite path. Backend is complete; the Members tab UI that
  drives it lands in a follow-up.
  - `GET /api/account/invitations` — list outstanding (admin+).
  - `POST /api/account/invitations` — create an invite, returns
    the plaintext token + share URL **exactly once** (we store
    only the SHA-256 hash on the row). Body
    `{ role, expiresInDays?, label? }`. Admin+.
  - `DELETE /api/account/invitations/[id]` — revoke (admin+).
  - `GET /api/invitations/[token]/peek` — public, per-IP
    rate-limited. Returns `{ ok, account_name, role, expires_at }`
    or `{ ok: false, reason }` so the join page can render
    "You're being invited to <Account> as <Role>".
  - `POST /api/invitations/[token]/redeem` — authenticated.
    Atomically moves the caller's profile to the inviter's
    account and cleans up the orphan personal account. Refuses
    with 409 if the caller's current account already contains
    domain data (no silent data loss).

### Migration required

Apply against your Supabase project before deploying this version:

- `supabase/migrations/017_account_sharing.sql` — introduces the
  `accounts` and `account_invitations` tables plus an
  `account_role_enum` type; adds `account_id` to every
  user-scoped table and backfills it; rewrites every RLS policy;
  replaces the new-user trigger. Idempotent. **No data loss** —
  every existing user is mapped to a freshly-created account
  with role `owner` and every existing row of theirs is linked
  to that account.
- `supabase/migrations/018_account_member_rpcs.sql` — adds three
  `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs (`set_member_role`,
  `remove_account_member`, `transfer_account_ownership`) that
  back the member-management API. They self-check the caller's
  role and raise SQLSTATE `42501` / `22023` on forbidden / bad
  input so the API layer can map cleanly to 403 / 400.
  Idempotent.
- `supabase/migrations/019_invitation_rpcs.sql` — adds two
  `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs: `peek_invitation` (anonymous read by
  token hash, returns a fixed-shape JSON envelope) and
  `redeem_invitation` (authenticated atomic move + orphan
  cleanup, with a domain-data safety check). Both bypass the
  RLS that would otherwise block their reads/writes. Idempotent.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-29

Flow nodes can now send media. Closes the most-requested gap from user
feedback after the v0.2.0 Flows launch — flows were text-only and
couldn't deliver an invoice, receipt, product photo, or short demo
video mid-conversation.

### Added

- **`send_media` flow node.** Send an image (PNG / JPEG / WebP), video
  (MP4 / 3GP), or document (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, TXT) to the
  customer from any point in a flow. Pick a file in the builder, it
  uploads to the new `flow-media` Supabase Storage bucket, and Meta
  fetches the public URL at send time. Optional caption (1024 char cap,
  supports `{{vars.X}}` interpolation); documents also take an optional
  filename shown in the recipient's chat. Auto-advances after send —
  same suspend semantics as `send_message`.
  ([#156](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/156))

### Migration required

Apply against your Supabase project before deploying this version:

- `supabase/migrations/016_flow_media.sql` — does two things:
  1. Adds `'send_media'` to the `flow_nodes.node_type` CHECK
     constraint. Without this the `send_media` node fails to save with
     a constraint violation.
  2. Creates the public `flow-media` Supabase Storage bucket (16 MB
     file-size cap, image / video / document MIME allowlist) plus
     per-user RLS policies (path prefix = `auth.uid()`). Without this
     the builder's file picker fails on upload. Same shape as the
     `avatars` bucket from migration 008 — the bucket is **public** so
     Meta can fetch the URL without credentials.

The migration is idempotent and safe to re-run.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-26

Bug-fix release. Plugs a silent inbound-message drop that triggered
when two users on the same instance saved the same WhatsApp
`phone_number_id`.

### Fixed

- **Inbound WhatsApp messages no longer silently disappear** when two
  users have claimed the same `phone_number_id`. Previously the
  webhook used `.single()` to look up the owning config, which errors
  `PGRST116` for both 0 rows *and* ≥2 rows — the second user's save
  put the DB into the ≥2-row state and every inbound message was
  dropped while the log misleadingly reported *"No config found for
  phone_number_id"*. Three layers of fix: `POST /api/whatsapp/config`
  now returns **409** when another user has already claimed the
  number, the webhook lookup distinguishes 0 rows from ≥2 rows and
  logs the conflicting `user_id`s, and a new DB constraint
  (`UNIQUE(phone_number_id)`) prevents the bad state at the storage
  layer. Reported in
  [#136](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/issues/136), fixed in
  [#143](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/143).

### Migration required

Apply against your Supabase project before deploying this version:

- `supabase/migrations/013_whatsapp_config_phone_number_id_unique.sql`
  — adds `UNIQUE(phone_number_id)` to `whatsapp_config`. **Fails
  loudly with a copy-pasteable resolution hint** if duplicate rows
  already exist; auto-deduping would destroy encrypted tokens, so
  the operator picks which row keeps the number. To check first:

  ```sql
  SELECT phone_number_id, array_agg(user_id) AS owners, count(*) AS n
  FROM whatsapp_config
  GROUP BY phone_number_id
  HAVING count(*) > 1;
  ```

  If that returns rows, `DELETE` the duplicate row(s) you want to
  drop, then re-run the migration.

### Note on multi-user setups

wacrm is intentionally **single-tenant per WhatsApp number**. RLS on
`conversations`/`messages` is `auth.uid() = user_id`, so a second
user physically cannot read messages routed to a different owner —
two users sharing one number was never supported. If you need
multiple humans handling the same inbox, run them under one shared
account.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-22

The **Flows** release. Adds a no-code, branching, button-driven WhatsApp
conversation engine that runs alongside Automations. Also ships a
5-theme color picker in Settings and opens Flows to all users.

### Added

#### Flows — branching chatbot conversations

- **Module + schema.** New `flows`, `flow_nodes`, `flow_runs`,
  `flow_run_events` tables with partial unique indexes that enforce
  one active run per contact. Widened `messages.content_type` CHECK
  to accept `'interactive'`; added `interactive_reply_id` column so
  the inbox can render button/list taps.
  ([#112](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/112))
- **Runner engine.** `dispatchInboundToFlows` parses every inbound
  webhook, decides whether the message is a reply on an active run
  or a fresh trigger, advances the state machine, and reports back
  to the webhook so consumed messages don't also fire automations.
  Idempotent on Meta's `message_id`.
  ([#114](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/114))
- **No-code builder UI** at `/flows`. Linear-list editor with
  per-node config forms, live validator, draft/active/archived
  status, and a 5-route REST API (`GET/POST /api/flows`,
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/flows/[id]`, `POST /api/flows/[id]/activate`,
  `GET /api/flows/[id]/runs`, `GET /api/flows/templates`).
  ([#115](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/115))
- **Templates + v1.5 node types.** Three starter templates
  (Welcome menu, FAQ bot, Lead capture) cloneable from the New-flow
  dialog. Three new node types: `collect_input` (capture customer
  text into a variable), `condition` (branch on var / tag / contact
  field), `set_tag` (add or remove a tag). `{{vars.X}}` interpolation
  in send_message + collect_input prompts. Per-flow run-history
  viewer at `/flows/[id]/runs`.
  ([#117](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/117))
- **Stale-run sweep cron** at `GET /api/flows/cron` — marks runs
  past their configured timeout (default 24h) as `timed_out` so
  abandoned conversations free up the contact for new triggers.
  Reuses `AUTOMATION_CRON_SECRET`.
  ([#114](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/114))

#### Color themes

- **5 color themes** (Violet default, Emerald, Cobalt, Amber, Rose)
  selectable from a new **Appearance** tab in Settings. CSS variables
  scoped under `html[data-theme="..."]`, applied at runtime via
  `dataset.theme`, persisted to `localStorage`. Inline boot script in
  `layout.tsx` replays the choice before first paint so there's no
  flash of the default.
  ([#132](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/132))
- **Theme tokenization sweep** — every previously hard-coded
  `violet-*` Tailwind class replaced with `primary` tokens across
  ~49 files. Picking a non-violet theme now themes the whole app,
  not just the chrome.
  ([#133](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/133))

### Changed

#### Flows — soft-GA

- **Flows is now available to every authenticated user.** The
  per-account beta gate is gone; the sidebar entry + page header
  carry a small "Beta" chip as the only remaining signal.
  ([#134](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/134))
- **Editor UX**:
  - Internal `node_key` + per-button/row `reply_id` identifiers
    hidden behind a per-node "Show advanced" disclosure.
    ([#118](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/118))
  - `send_list` nodes can have multiple sections.
    ([#119](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/119))
  - Collapsed node cards show a 1-line content preview per node
    type (text excerpt, button titles, condition summary, etc.).
    ([#120](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/120))
  - Validation issues are clickable: jump to + flash the offending
    node.
    ([#121](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/121))
  - Unsaved-changes "● Edited" indicator + `beforeunload` reload
    guard.
    ([#122](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/122))
  - New-flow dialog actually widens to fit the 3 template cards
    (was capped at 384px by a baked-in `sm:max-w-sm` from shadcn).
    ([#129](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/129),
    [#131](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/131))
  - Validation panel pinned to the viewport bottom so
    activate-readiness follows the user as they scroll through nodes.
    ([#130](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/130))

#### Engine reliability

- **Atomic `execution_count` increment** via SECURITY DEFINER RPC —
  prevents lost counts when two webhooks start runs concurrently.
  Mirrors the automations engine pattern.
  ([#124](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/124))
- **Preload all flow_nodes once per dispatch** — one SELECT per
  inbound instead of one per advance-loop iteration. A 5-node
  auto-advance chain now costs 1 round trip, not 5.
  ([#125](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/125))
- **Wasted re-read dropped** after reprompt reset; `loadActiveRun`
  switched to defensive `.limit(1)` so a migration glitch producing
  duplicates can't crash dispatch.
  ([#126](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/126))

### Security

- **PII redacted from `reply_received` event payload** — customer
  text is no longer persisted to `flow_run_events.payload`; only
  the length is. A `collect_input` prompt asking "what's your card
  number?" used to leave the PAN sitting in the events table.
  ([#123](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/123))
- **Constant-time cron-secret compare** on `/api/flows/cron`
  (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) to close a theoretical
  timing-side-channel on the `x-cron-secret` header check.
  ([#127](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/127))

### Fixed

- **`/flows` no longer spuriously redirects to `/dashboard`** when
  navigating in. Root cause: `useAuth` flipped `loading: false`
  before the profile fetch resolved. `use-auth` now exposes a
  separate `profileLoading` boolean.
  ([#128](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/128))

### Migration required

Apply, in order, against your Supabase project:

1. `supabase/migrations/010_flows.sql` — Flows core tables, indexes,
   RLS policies, and the `messages` schema widening.
2. `supabase/migrations/011_profile_beta_features.sql` — adds the
   `profiles.beta_features` column. Surviving for future betas;
   Flows no longer reads it.
3. `supabase/migrations/012_flows_increment_counter.sql` — atomic
   counter RPC. Without this the engine still runs but
   `flows.execution_count` is racy.

Each migration is idempotent — safe to re-run if you're not sure
whether you applied a previous one.

### Removed

- **`src/lib/flows/feature-flag.ts`** + its tests. Flows is open to
  all users; the `profiles.beta_features` column itself survives
  for future beta gates.
  ([#134](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/pull/134))

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- Chat actions in the inbox: emoji reactions, reply-with-quote, and
  copy-text on individual messages. Hover on desktop, long-press on
  touch. Outbound reactions and replies forward to WhatsApp via the
  Cloud API; inbound reactions and swipe-replies from customers
  arrive through the webhook and appear in real time.

### Migration required

- Apply `supabase/migrations/009_message_actions.sql` to your
  Supabase project. It adds `messages.reply_to_message_id` and the
  new `message_reactions` table (with RLS and realtime). The
  migration is idempotent — safe to re-run.

### Changed

- The webhook no longer stores inbound customer reactions as fake
  text messages. They are written to `message_reactions` instead,
  so any custom queries that counted reactions as messages will
  need updating.

---

## [0.1.0]

Initial template release. Core CRM: inbox, contacts, pipelines,
broadcasts, automations (with a Wait-step cron drain), WhatsApp
Cloud API integration, Supabase auth + RLS.
